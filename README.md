## Projects
### Deciphering Global Climate Patterns: A Comprehensive Analysis of Temperature Anomalies using Python

Utilised Python and its powerful data analysis libraries to conduct an extensive study on global temperature data, spanning from 1880 to the present. This project involved a detailed analysis of monthly and annual temperature anomalies, revealing significant long-term warming trends across the globe. By employing statistical techniques like linear regression, the study confirmed the rising temperature patterns with a high degree of statistical significance (R-squared > 0.9). The analysis highlighted that certain months showed more pronounced temperature increases, suggesting a nuanced pattern of global warming. This project not only reaffirms the ongoing phenomenon of global climate change but also emphasises the capability of Python-based analysis to extract meaningful insights from large-scale environmental datasets. The findings underscore the critical need for policy-driven responses to climate change, offering a data-driven foundation for understanding the intricate dynamics of our planet's climate system.
