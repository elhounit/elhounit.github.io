#### Deciphering Global Climate Patterns: A Comprehensive Analysis of Temperature Anomalies using Python

This project utilised Python to analyse over a century of global temperature data, uncovering significant warming trends. Statistical analysis, including linear regression, revealed pronounced changes in temperature anomalies, confirming the realities of global climate change. The insights drawn from this data-driven approach emphasise the urgent need for informed environmental policies and actions.
